# WaffleCopter

WaffleCopter delivers hot waffles fresh off the iron straight to your location
using quad-rotor GPS-enabled helicopters. The service is currently being tested
in private beta in select locations.

Your goal is to order one of the decadent Li√®ge waffles, offered only to the
first premium subscribers of the service.

## The API

The WaffleCopter API is quite simple. All users have a secret API token that is
used to sign POST requests to /v1/orders. Parameters such as the waffle product
code and target GPS coordinates are encoded as if for a query string and placed
in the request body.

## The Code

You can use `client.py` to talk to the API, specifying an appropriate API
endpoint, user id, and secret key. The app itself is `wafflecopter.py`, which
will use a SQLite database created by `initialize_db.py`. To edit flask
settings, just create a `local_settings.py` file. The page templates can be
found under `templates/`.
