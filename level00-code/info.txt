Welcome to Capture the Flag! If you find yourself stuck or want to learn more about web security in general, we've prepared a list of helpful resources for you. You can chat with fellow solvers in the CTF chatroom (also accessible in your favorite IRC client at irc://irc.stripe.com:+6697/ctf). 

We'll start you out with Level 0, the Secret Safe. The Secret Safe is designed as a secure place to store all of your secrets. It turns out that the password to access Level 1 is stored within the Secret Safe. If only you knew how to crack safes... 

You can access the Secret Safe at https://level00-1.stripe-ctf.com/user-zhlxfvpwex. The Safe's code is included below, and can also be obtained via git clone https://level00-1.stripe-ctf.com/user-zhlxfvpwex/level00-code.
